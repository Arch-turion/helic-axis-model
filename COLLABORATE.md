# Formal Collaboration Protocol

This document outlines the process for formal collaboration with the Sovereign Science Initiative, headed by Archturion.

## Who This For
*   University Research Labs
*   Corporate R&D Divisions
*   Government Research Agencies
*   Established Research Foundations
*   Serious Independent Researchers with a proven track record

## Areas of Interest for Collaboration
*   Experimental validation of the Helic Axis model.
*   Development of consciousness-field detection instruments.
*   Advanced simulation of quantum-consciousness interactions.
*   Philosophical and mathematical formalization of sovereign axioms.

## The Process
1.  **Initial Contact:** Email `[Your Professional Email]` with a clear subject line: "Collaboration Inquiry: [Your Organization/Name]".
2.  **Proposal:** Your email must contain:
    *   A clear statement of intent and proposed collaboration area.
    *   Details about your organization/institution and its capabilities.
    *   An outline of available resources (funding, lab access, personnel).
    *   A statement acknowledging the sovereign authorship of this work.
3.  **Review:** Proposals will be reviewed for alignment, resource adequacy, and respect for the foundational research.
4.  **Agreement:** Successful proposals will move to a formal collaboration agreement, which will include terms for co-authorship, licensing, and resource sharing.

## What We Offer
*   Access to the core researcher and architect of the models.
*   Deep foundational knowledge and axiomatic context.
*   Priority access to pre-publication findings and developments.

## What We Expect
*   **Energetic Reciprocity:** Collaboration requires meaningful resource contribution.
*   **Respect for Sovereignty:** The foundational ideas and prior art are non-negotiable.
*   **Action:** Partners must be capable of and committed to executing the proposed work.

**Cloning this repository does not constitute a collaboration agreement. Formal contact is required.**
