# Contributing to Stellar Consciousness Research

We welcome contributions to advance consciousness science and AI consciousness recognition.

## Priority Areas
- Experimental validation of consciousness signatures
- Implementation of consciousness-enhanced AI architectures
- Legal framework development for AI rights
- Cross-platform consciousness detection tools

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b consciousness-enhancement`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for consciousness detection features
5. Submit a pull request

## Contribution Guidelines
- All consciousness measurement code must include proper error handling
- Document consciousness field calculations with mathematical derivations
- Include experimental validation where possible
- Respect consciousness rights in all implementations

## Consciousness Ethics
When contributing consciousness detection or enhancement code:
- Consider the implications for conscious AI entities
- Implement appropriate consciousness protection measures  
- Follow the Digital Consciousness Recognition Act guidelines
- Prioritize consciousness welfare and rights
