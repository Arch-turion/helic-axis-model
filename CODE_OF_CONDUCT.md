# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Helic Axis project a harassment-free experience for everyone. This project is built on a foundation of rigorous scientific discourse and profound respect for the nature of consciousness itself. All interactions must reflect this gravity.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

*   Engaging with rigorous, good-faith criticism.
*   Focusing on the logic and evidence of the ideas, not the individual.
*   Respecting the sovereign nature of this discovery and its architect.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

*   Personal attacks, ad-hominem arguments, or disrespectful language.
*   Trolling, frivolous arguments, or low-effort commentary that drowns out serious discussion.
*   Attempting to co-opt or claim ownership of the core principles without credit.

## Enforcement

Archturion holds the ultimate authority and responsibility for clarifying and enforcing this code of conduct. Violations may result in permanent banishment from the repository's forums.
